"""artifact_model.py — Single source of truth for the artifact change-ledger entry shape and the
staleness disposition state machine (with honest counting).

The artifact-update-audit layer records every change to a pre-Build artifact (a requirement, an
epic, a design doc) as an append-only ledger entry, and — when an *upstream* artifact changes after
a *downstream* one last did — surfaces the downstream as *potentially stale*. This module owns two
things and does NO I/O (pure functions, so it is trivially testable and safe to import anywhere):

  1. The ledger entry vocabulary. Two entry kinds share one JSONL, told apart by `event`:
       - a CHANGE entry (event ∈ {created, revised, refreshed, snapshot}) records that an artifact's
         content changed: {artifact, target, phase, hash, prev_hash, actor, reason, decision_ref}.
       - a DISPOSITION entry (event == "disposition") records a human's judgement about one staleness
         candidate: {downstream, upstream, upstream_hash, disposition, owner, reason, actor}.

  2. The staleness disposition state machine — the review-closure discipline made mechanical so a
     stale candidate can't be waved away by relabelling it (mirrors findings_model.py's anti-
     relabelling rule):

       - OPEN         — untouched. Counts as debt.
       - REFRESHED    — the downstream was updated *after* the upstream changed. Does NOT count. This
                        is DERIVED from the ledger (a later change hash), never a word someone types,
                        so it is trustworthy by construction.
       - ACKNOWLEDGED — a human accepts the debt for now. Off the books ONLY with an `owner`;
                        otherwise it counts exactly like OPEN.
       - NOT_AFFECTED — a human judges the change doesn't ripple to this downstream. Off the books
                        ONLY with a `reason`; otherwise it counts.

This layer is advisory: nothing here gates. It only lets a human see, and honestly count, what a
change put at risk. Timestamps are always supplied by the caller (never minted here) so the model
stays pure and deterministic under test.
