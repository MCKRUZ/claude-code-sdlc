"""Every agent this plugin names must be an agent that exists.

Spawning an agent that does not exist is the worst kind of failure this repo can ship: it does
not raise, it does not warn, and the phase carries on as though the work were done. A team runs
Phase 7, the definition says the API documentation is being generated, and `api-docs.md` simply
never appears.

Not hypothetical. Phases 7, 8 and 9 spawned seven agents by name and **six did not exist**
(`doc-updater`, `backend-architect`, `devops-automator`, `e2e-runner`, `performance-benchmarker`,
`feedback-synthesizer`). `references/agent-roster.md` and `docs/agents.md` documented **thirteen**
that did not exist, six of them in the Build-loop table — the most-exercised part of the product —
and `docs/agents.md` asserted they were "Built-in Claude Code subagents" supplied by the runtime.
They never were. That false belief is the likeliest reason nobody built them.

What may be named:

* `agents/*.md` — the SDLC agents that ship in this plugin
* `harness/agents/*.md` — installed into the client repo by `/sdlc-harness`
* a small allowlist of Claude Code built-ins and sibling-plugin agents, listed explicitly below so
  that adding to it is a deliberate act rather than a typo that silently passes
