"""/sdlc-next must not ask for sign-off while a sign-off question is unconfirmed.

The confirmations are recorded by a script, but the rule that they matter lives in the command's
instructions to Claude — the protected advance script is deliberately untouched. So the
instructions are pinned here: if the step goes missing, the checkboxes stop meaning anything and
nothing else would notice.
