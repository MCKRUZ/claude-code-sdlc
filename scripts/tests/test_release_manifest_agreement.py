"""The version lives in three files, and a bump that misses one fails silently.

`RELEASING.md` step 3 already says to bump `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` **and**
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, "they must match", and step 4 says to write the CHANGELOG
entry. Nothing enforced any of it, and the 1.1.0 release proved why that matters: the branch
bumped `plugin.json` and never touched `marketplace.json`, so when it was merged after the 1.0.1
stack, git **auto-merged** the marketplace file to 1.0.1. No conflict, no marker, no failing test —
a valid JSON file holding the wrong number.

The two versions are read by different consumers, which is what makes the mismatch expensive:

* `plugin.json` is what `scripts/harness_manifest.py` stamps into every installed repo's
  `.claude/harness-manifest.json`, so it is the version an engagement reports it runs and the one
  `/sdlc-upgrade` compares against.
* `marketplace.json` is what Claude Code reads to decide whether an update exists.

When the marketplace lags, the release is published and no one is offered it. The installed repos
that do upgrade then report a version the marketplace says was never released.

This is the guard the release procedure was relying on a human to be.
