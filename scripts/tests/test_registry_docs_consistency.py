"""The registry is the enforcement; the docs and phase bodies have to agree with it.

`check_gates.py` blocks a phase on `artifacts.required` in `phases/phase-registry.yaml` — nothing
else. So the registry is what a team actually experiences. Three other places describe the same
list to a human, and none of them is consulted at gate time:

* the phase definition's `### `<name>`` artifact spec — what Claude reads to know what to produce
* `docs/phase-lifecycle.md`'s **Required Artifacts** table — what a person reads to plan the phase
* the same file's **Optional Artifacts** list — which must not also name a required artifact

When those disagree, the gate wins silently and the team finds out by being blocked on a file
nobody told them to write.

Not hypothetical. The 1.0.0 "Fix 3" migration added twelve required receipts to the registry and
updated none of the prose: `docs/phase-lifecycle.md` was missing eleven of them, still listed
`go-no-go-record.md` and `drill-record.md` as *optional*, and two of the twelve
(`drill-record.md`, `go-no-go-record.md`) had no artifact spec in any phase definition at all —
required by the gate, described nowhere. Issues #31, #33 and #35 were three separate reports of
that one migration. This test is what makes the next such migration fail here instead of at a
client's Phase 9 gate.
