"""findings_model.py — Single source of truth for review-finding severity, disposition, identity.

A review (/sdlc-review — the grader) surfaces findings. Per the delivery-standard the grader
*advises, never blocks* (the-rails.md §4): so this module does NOT gate. What it does is give a
finding a stable identity, a disposition with honest counting rules, and one arithmetic for
"how much open HIGH+ debt is on the table" — the number the human Checker weighs at the merge bar.

The disposition state machine is the standard's review-closure discipline made mechanical, so a
finding can't be waved away by relabelling it (build-loop.md §Discern; ported from the reference
harness's review-closure gate):

  - OPEN           — untouched. Counts as debt.
  - FIXED          — verified fixed. Does NOT count. ("Verified" is factual — a claim that a file
                     changed when it didn't is caught by the FIXED-claim check in record_findings.)
  - SPLIT          — deferred to a tracked unit. Off the books only when it names BOTH a task/spec
                     id AND an owner; otherwise it counts.
  - ACCEPTED_RISK  — a human signed off on carrying the risk. Off the books only with all four of
                     approver / date / reason / review_condition, AND a *human* approver — an AI may
                     not absolve its own work ("agent proposes, gate disposes", the-rails.md).
  - POSTPONED      — deferred without a home. STILL COUNTS. Debt is not resolution.

Severity is the review's own scale (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). to_gate_severity() maps it onto the
mechanical MUST/SHOULD/INFO scale so the two vocabularies reconcile; open *debt* is HIGH+.
