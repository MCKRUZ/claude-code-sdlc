"""doctor.py — day-1 check that the installed harness will actually run.

The harness fails quietly. Hooks that are registered but whose interpreter is missing, rails
scripts installed without the executable bit, a repo secret the gates need that nobody set — each
of these leaves a repo that *looks* set up and has no working checking ladder. Two of the three
bugs found on the first real install were exactly that shape.

So this checks the things that are invisible when they are wrong:

    uv run scripts/doctor.py                 # in the client repo
    uv run scripts/doctor.py --repo <path>
    uv run scripts/doctor.py --offline       # skip the checks that need gh/az

Exit 1 if anything FAILs. WARN never fails the run — it marks what could not be determined.

Platform-aware: the manifest's composed pack ids say which CI platform this install realized
(cicd/github vs cicd/azure-devops), and the platform-facing checks follow it — an Azure DevOps
install is checked with az (variable groups, branch policies), never told to install gh for a
platform it does not use. Anything that is not recognizably an ADO install gets the GitHub
checks, exactly as before the packs existed.
