"""Install the delivery harness (the kit) from the plugin's bundled payload into a target repo.

Called by /sdlc-setup after .sdlc/ is initialized. Idempotent: existing files are left in place
and reported as SKIPPED unless --force is given. The payload is the plugin's `harness/` directory,
a generated copy of delivery-standard/kit (see scripts/sync_kit.py).

Two modes:
  * core-only (no --profile): copy the neutral kit — CLAUDE.md full of {{TOKENS}}, placeholder
    workflows. The base case a repo adapts by hand.
  * profile-aware (--profile <profile.yaml>): compose core + the stack pack + the CI/CD pack + any
    tools packs the profile selects. The packs' realized files OVERLAY the core placeholders (last
    wins), the .NET tooling permissions are MERGED into settings.json, pack MCP fragments are MERGED
    into the repo's .mcp.json (core ships context7 / sequential-thinking / playwright; the stack and
    CI/CD packs add their own, e.g. microsoft-learn, azure-devops), and the stack pack's standards
    are spliced into CLAUDE.md's "## Stack standards — {{STACK}}" section. Tools packs (the third axis,
    multi-select via a top-level `tools: [id, ...]`) integrate optional, often self-installing tools:
    they overlay only a small static surface (config + a SETUP guide) and the installer PRINTS their
    manual setup steps — it never runs them. Selection is driven entirely by the profile's own stack
    block (language -> stack pack, ci_cd.platform -> CI/CD pack) plus the `tools` list; the mapping
    lives in one place (the resolver tables below). The two axes degrade independently: a valid stack
    or platform with no pack built yet installs the neutral core for that axis and prints a WARNING
    (setup never fails just because a pack is missing), while an incompatible pair or a pack that is
    mapped but absent from the payload still fails closed (real breakage, not "not built yet").

  When BOTH a stack pack and a CI/CD pack compose, the seam between them is filled MECHANICALLY:
  the stack's ci-profile.yaml (toolchain + commands + coverage floor) is joined with the CI/CD
  pack's toolchain_map (its platform's setup action/task per toolchain id) into a <<CI_*>> token
  table, and every file the CI/CD pack overlays is substituted AS IT IS COPIED (see ci_tokens.py).
  A <<CI_*>> token surviving that substitution fails the install closed — a literal token is never
  written. When the stack axis DEGRADED (no stack pack) but a CI/CD pack composed, the tokens are
  deliberately LEFT in place and reported as a WARNING: the axes still degrade independently.

  This does NOT fill per-repo tokens ({{SOLUTION_OR_PROJECT}}, <<GATED_PATHS>>, <<EVAL_TEST_PROJECT>>,
  deploy wiring, reviewer models): those are genuinely repo-level Phase-3 adaptation, not something a
  profile knows, and they pass through substitution untouched. The profile drives which packs compose
  and what the seam resolves to, not repo-specific values.

Fail-closed: a FILE_MAP/DIR_MAP/EXTRA_FILES source missing from the payload, or a pack.yaml
overlay src missing from its pack, still logs a MISS line for EVERY missing item (the scan
completes; it never stops at the first), then the run exits 2 — a partial install never exits 0.
Files the maps deliberately leave unmapped are simply not installed; that is not a MISS.

Every successful run ends by writing .claude/harness-manifest.json in the target: the composed
PRISTINE state (sha256 of the final on-disk content) of every dest the run touched, plus the
plugin version, profile id, and composed pack ids. upgrade_harness.py reads it to three-way
classify local adaptation vs. upstream change. SKIPPED files are never recorded; on re-runs,
entries for untouched dests are preserved. See harness_manifest.py for the schema.

Usage:
  uv run --project ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/install_harness.py \
    --payload ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/harness --target . [--profile <profile.yaml>] [--force]
