"""Upgrade an installed delivery harness against a new plugin payload.

Three-way classification per file: the target's .claude/harness-manifest.json holds the
PRISTINE hash of what the last install composed (oldP), a fresh compose of the new payload
into a temp directory yields the new pristine (newP), and the file on disk is the current
state (cur). Comparing all three separates "the repo adapted this" from "upstream changed
this" — updates apply cleanly where the repo never touched the file, adaptations are kept,
and genuine two-sided divergence becomes a CONFLICT sibling (<file>.harness-new) for a human
to merge; the upgrade never overwrites local work.

Default is a DRY-RUN report; --apply performs the changes and refreshes the manifest.
Pass the SAME --profile the harness was installed with, or pack-composed files will look
retired. A target without a manifest is a LEGACY install: everything is classified as
untracked, and --apply adopts the pristine-matching files into a fresh manifest.

Exit codes: 0 on success (conflicts included — reporting them is the job), 2 on
InstallError-class problems (bad payload/profile/manifest), never a raw traceback.

Usage:
  uv run --project ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/upgrade_harness.py \
    --payload ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/harness --target . [--profile <profile.yaml>] [--apply]
