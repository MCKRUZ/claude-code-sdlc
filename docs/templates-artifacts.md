## 1. Template System Overview

Templates define the required structure and sections for every SDLC artifact. They are the
contract between phase work and gate validation -- a template declares what must exist, and the
gate system checks that it does.

### Core Principles

- **Templates are blueprints, not content.** They contain placeholder markers (`[brackets]`,
  `TODO`, `TBD`) that must be replaced with real project-specific content during phase work.
- **Stored in the plugin directory.** Templates live under `templates/` inside the
  claude-code-sdlc plugin repository, not in target projects.
- **Copied at initialization.** When `/sdlc-setup` runs, templates are copied to the target
  project's `.sdlc/artifacts/` directory, organized by phase.
- **Gate validation depends on templates.** Gate 1 (Existence) checks that every required
  artifact file exists. Gate 2 (Completeness) scans for unfilled placeholders -- any remaining
  `[bracket text]`, `TODO`, or `TBD` markers cause the gate to fail.
- **Phase-specific organization.** Each phase has its own template subdirectory, named by its
  phase slug (`00-discovery`, `03-foundation`, `build`, `close`, ...), containing the artifacts
  required for that phase.

### Template Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Markdown artifacts** | Structured documents with sections, tables, and placeholder content | `constitution.md`, `requirements.md` |
| **JSON tracking files** | Machine-readable state for implementation progress | `sections-progress.json`, `session-handoff.json` |
| **YAML state** | Project state machine definition | `state-init.yaml` |
| **Handoff documents** | Phase transition records with open questions and risk summaries | `phase1-handoff.md`, `phase2-handoff.md`, `phase3-handoff.md`, `build-handoff.md`, `phase7-handoff.md`, `phase8-handoff.md`, `phase9-handoff.md`, `close-handoff.md` (the chain jumps 3 → `build-handoff` → 7 — there is no phase4/5/6-handoff) |

### Root-Level Quick-Start Templates

In addition to the phase-organized templates, six root-level files provide simplified versions
for rapid project bootstrapping:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `state-init.yaml` | Initial state machine (used by all projects) |
| `constitution.md` | Simplified constitution template |
| `design-doc.md` | Simplified design document template |
| `requirements.md` | Simplified requirements template |
| `test-plan.md` | Simplified test plan template |
| `release-checklist.md` | Simplified release checklist template |

These root-level templates are shorter, less prescriptive versions of their phase-specific
counterparts. The phase-specific versions under `phases/` are the authoritative templates used
by the full SDLC workflow.

## 3. Phase 0: Discovery Artifacts

Discovery establishes project identity, defines the problem, and sets boundaries. All four
artifacts plus the handoff document are required to pass the Phase 0 exit gate.

### constitution.md -- Project Identity Document

The constitution is the foundational document that defines what the project is and how decisions
are made. It is referenced throughout every subsequent phase.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Project Identity** | Basic project metadata | Project name, profile ID, creation date |
| **Mission Statement** | Why this project exists in one paragraph | Problem being solved, who benefits, core value proposition |
| **Governing Principles** | Decision-making framework (minimum 3) | Each principle needs a name, statement, and "In Practice" example |
| **Decision Authority** | Who decides what | Authority matrix for architecture, scope, schedule, quality decisions |
| **Amendment Process** | How to change the constitution | Threshold for changes, approval process, version tracking |
| **Version History** | Change log | Version number, date, changes made, approver |

**Special field -- `project_type`:** During Phase 0, the constitution must declare a `project_type`
value of one of: `service`, `app`, `library`, `skill`, or `cli`. This value is written into
`state.yaml` and controls which profile-specific gates and artifact requirements apply in later
phases.

### problem-statement.md -- Why This Project Exists

Defines the problem in rigorous, measurable terms. This is not a solution proposal -- it
describes the current state and quantifies the pain.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Executive Summary** | One-paragraph problem description | Non-technical summary accessible to any stakeholder |
| **Stakeholder Personas** | Who is affected | Name/role, their pain, impact severity, current workaround |
| **Current State: Process Flow** | How things work today | Description of current workflow or system behavior |
| **Current State: Metrics** | Quantified baseline | Current performance numbers that will be compared against success criteria |
| **Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)** | Why the problem persists | Chain of causation from symptom to root cause |
| **Problem Scope** | Boundaries of the problem | What is in scope, what is explicitly out of scope |
| **Opportunity Statement** | What solving this enables | Future state description, projected improvement |

### success-criteria.md -- How We Know It Worked

Defines measurable outcomes with explicit thresholds for Pass, Partial success, and Fail. This
document is the accountability contract -- it prevents scope creep and goal-post shifting.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Measurable Success Dimensions** (min. 3) | What we measure | Each dimension needs: what we measure, Pass/Partial/Fail thresholds with specific numbers, data collection method |
| **Non-Negotiable Requirements** | Hard fail conditions | Specific conditions that constitute absolute failure regardless of other metrics |
| **Time to Value** | When we expect results | Milestones with dates for when each dimension becomes measurable |
| **Success Owner** | Who is accountable | Named individual responsible for measuring and reporting results |

Each dimension uses a structured table:

```markdown
| Outcome | Threshold | How We'll Measure |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Pass    | [Specific number/condition] | [Measurement method] |
| Partial | [Specific number/condition] | [Measurement method] |
| Fail    | [Specific number/condition] | [Measurement method] |
```

"Better" is not a valid threshold. "20% faster" is.

### constraints.md -- Non-Negotiable Boundaries

Documents every constraint that limits the solution space, with rationale for each. An
undocumented constraint is a surprise waiting to happen.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Constraint Register** (min. 3 entries) | Master list | Each constraint (C-NN) with type, rationale, solution impact, owner |
| **Technical Constraints: Must Use / Cannot Use** | Technology boundaries | Required and prohibited technologies with justification |
| **Technical Constraints: Integration Requirements** | External system dependencies | Systems that must be integrated, their APIs, SLAs |
| **Technical Constraints: Performance / Scale Envelope** | Performance boundaries | Throughput, latency, concurrency, and data volume limits |
| **Business Constraints: Timeline** | Schedule boundaries | Hard deadlines, milestone dates, external dependencies |
| **Business Constraints: Budget** | Cost boundaries | Financial constraints affecting technology choices |
| **Business Constraints: Team / Resource** | People boundaries | Available roles, FTEs, skill levels, availability windows |
| **Legal and Compliance Constraints** | Regulatory boundaries | Applicable regulations, data residency, audit requirements |
| **Assumptions** | What we take for granted | Stated assumptions with validation method and owner |
| **Constraint Change Protocol** | How constraints change | Process for requesting and approving constraint modifications |

**Constraint types:** Technical, Business, Legal/Compliance, Resource, Time.

### phase1-handoff.md -- Handoff to Requirements

Bridges Discovery to Requirements. See [Section 9: Handoff Document Protocol](#9-handoff-document-protocol)
for the standard format.

**Phase-specific content:**

- **Discovery Summary:** Compressed version of all four discovery artifacts

## 6. Phase 3: Foundation Artifacts

Foundation is the hinge where documents stop and software starts. It builds the factory --
installs/adapts the harness, stands up the CI/CD rails, gates, and dev infrastructure -- and
deploys a thin "walking skeleton" end-to-end into the dev environment. Its required artifacts are
`foundation-report.md`, `risk-tier-map.md`, `cadence-plan.md`, and `build-handoff.md`. The
`section-plans/` sub-directory holds the per-change planning templates that the Build loop draws
from.

### foundation-report.md -- Walking Skeleton and Rails Report

Records that the factory is real: the harness is installed/adapted, the CI/CD pipeline and gates
are live, dev infrastructure is provisioned, and a thin end-to-end walking skeleton is deployed
into dev.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Overview** | Foundation summary | What was stood up, where the walking skeleton is deployed |
| **Harness Setup** | The installed factory | Which harness/profile was installed or adapted, and how |
| **CI/CD Rails and Gates** | Pipeline state | Pipeline stages, the gates wired in, where they run |
| **Dev Infrastructure** | Provisioned environment | Environments, services, and access stood up for the build loop |
| **Walking Skeleton** | Thin end-to-end slice | The minimal end-to-end path proven deployed into dev |

### risk-tier-map.md -- Risk Tier Map

Tiers project risks and registers the security gates that guard the higher tiers.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **HIGH tier** | Highest-risk areas | Areas demanding the strictest checking, with rationale |
| **MEDIUM tier** | Moderate-risk areas | Areas with standard checking |
| **LOW tier** | Lowest-risk areas | Areas with lightweight checking |
| **Registered Security Gates** | Gate registry | Which security gates apply to which tier and where they fire |

### cadence-plan.md -- Cadence Plan

Sets the rhythm of the Build loop: when work happens, how much is in flight, and the tripwire
that flags stalled review.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Cadence Calendar** | When work happens | The recurring rhythm of build/review beats |
| **WIP Cap** | Concurrency limit | Maximum changes allowed in flight at once |
| **Review-Wait Tripwire** | Stall detector | The threshold at which a change waiting on review raises a flag |

### build-handoff.md -- Handoff into the Build Loop

The ordered spec backlog that the Build loop consumes -- the bridge from Foundation into
continuous build.

**Required sections:**

| Section | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Ordered Spec Backlog** | The build queue | Specs in implementation order, with dependencies |
| **Build Start Conditions** | Readiness checklist | Rails live, gates wired, walking skeleton deployed, owners assigned |
| **Constraints** | Build-loop ground rules | Coding standards, branching strategy, review requirements |
| **Key Risks Entering Build** | Carried-forward risks | Risks with active mitigations from the risk-tier map |

### section-plans/ -- Per-Change Section Plans

Section plans are the atomic unit of build work. They live under `03-foundation/section-plans/`,
and the Build loop draws from them per change. Each section gets its own file (`SECTION-NNN.md`)
based on one of two templates.

#### SECTION-template.md -- Pure SDLC Format

The standard section plan template with structured fields for gate validation and traceability.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Purpose | What Must Be Filled In |
|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **Header metadata** | Section identity | Owner, sprint assignment, estimated effort (S/M/L/XL), status |
| **Goal** | What this section delivers | One sentence describing the capability that exists when complete |
| **Epics / Stories Covered** | Traceability | List of EP-NNN and US-NNN identifiers this section implements |
| **Entry Criteria** | Prerequisites | Conditions that must be true before work begins |
| **Exit Criteria** | Definition of done | Specific, verifiable conditions (minimum 2) that mark completion |
| **Dependencies** | Ordering constraints | Other sections or external systems required |
| **Implementation Guidance** | Developer instructions | Key algorithms, patterns, pitfalls, and approach guidance |
| **Interfaces** | What this section exposes | Table of functions/APIs/events with type (internal/external) and contract |
| **Test Strategy** | Quality requirements | Coverage target by test type (unit/integration/e2e), key scenarios |
| **Risk** | Section-specific risks | Risks and mitigations specific to this section |
| **Verification Criteria** | How to verify each exit criterion | Pass condition, verification method, who verifies |
| **Evaluator Contract** | Grading rubric for section evaluator agent | Evaluation scope, grading rubric (5 dimensions), fail conditions (blocking), warn conditions (non-blocking) |

#### SECTION-template-deep-plan.md -- Hybrid SDLC + /deep-plan Format

A converged template that combines SDLC structured fields with full /deep-plan implementation
prose. This is the recommended template when using the `/deep-plan` skill integration.

**Differences from the pure template:**

| Aspect | Pure SDLC | Hybrid SDLC + /deep-plan |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Implementation Guidance** | Brief notes and pitfalls | Full /deep-plan prose: architecture decisions, code patterns, directory structure, function signatures, step-by-step instructions |
| **Test Strategy** | Coverage targets and key scenarios | Coverage targets plus a **TDD Test Stubs** subsection carrying the relevant slice of `claude-plan-tdd.md` |
| **Self-containment** | May reference external docs | Fully self-contained -- a developer can read only this section and start implementing |
| **deep-implement compatibility** | Standard implementation | `/deep-implement` reads the Implementation Guidance section as its primary input |

The Implementation Guidance section in the hybrid template is designed to carry the full
`/deep-plan` prose content verbatim. The structured SDLC fields (Goal, Epics, Entry/Exit
Criteria, Dependencies, Interfaces) wrap the section for gate validation and traceability,
while the prose carries the actual implementation instructions.

**Evaluator Contract (both templates):**

Both section plan templates include an Evaluator Contract that defines the grading rubric the
section evaluator agent uses after implementation completes:

1. **Functional completeness** -- all exit criteria pass conditions met
2. **Test quality** -- coverage target met, edge cases covered
3. **Interface compliance** -- exposed interfaces match the Interfaces table
4. **Code quality** -- functions within profile size limits, no deep nesting, immutability patterns
5. **Deviation accountability** -- any deviation from Implementation Guidance is documented with rationale

**Fail conditions (blocking):** exit criterion not met, coverage below target, interface contract
broken without documented ADR.

**Warn conditions (non-blocking):** code style deviations, missing edge case tests outside
critical path.

## 7. Build Loop Artifacts

The Build loop is the continuous middle of the SDLC. It replaces the old batch
Implementation/Quality/Testing phases: every change runs three beats -- **Intent** (decide and
write a spec), **Delegate** (bound and build from an approved plan), and **Discern** (prove the
change against its spec, by someone other than the author, then merge). There is no artifact exit
gate -- checking happens per change inside the loop, and a human declares the backlog
feature-complete to leave.

The loop's durable per-change record is `specs/` (the spec files in the repo). Under the `build/`
template directory it tracks rolling state in `build-summary.md` and the two JSON continuity
trackers, and emits `phase7-handoff.md` when the human declares the work feature-complete.

### specs/ -- Per-Change Specifications

Each change gets a spec file in the repo (`specs/NNNN-name.md`), written during the Intent beat.
The spec is the contract the change is built against and the artifact the Discern beat proves
against. Specs are the Build loop's durable per-change record; they live in the repository, not
under the template tree.

### build-summary.md -- Rolling Merged-Work Summary

A continuously updated summary of work merged through the Build loop -- what has shipped, what is
in flight, and the current state of the backlog. It is the human-readable counterpart to the
JSON trackers below.

### sections-progress.json -- Machine-Readable Progress Tracker

JSON file tracking section and sprint progress for automated tooling and dashboards.

**Schema version:** `sections-progress-v1`

```json
{
  "$schema": "sections-progress-v1",

      "goal": "",
      "sections": ["SECTION-001"],
      "status": "not_started"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field reference:**

| Field | Type | Description |

| `sections[].deviations` | integer | Count of deviations from design documented |
| `sections[].decisions` | integer | Count of implementation decisions made |
| `sprints[].status` | string | `not_started`, `in_progress`, `complete` |

### session-handoff.json -- Session Continuity State

JSON file enabling Build-loop continuity across Claude Code sessions. Updated at the end of
each session to provide context for the next session.

**Schema version:** `session-handoff-v1`

```json
{
  "$schema": "session-handoff-v1",
  "phase": "build",
  "last_updated": null,
  "session_number": 1,
  "overall_status": "in_progress",
  "current_sprint": 1,
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "SECTION-001",
      "name": "",
      "status": "not_started",
      "agent": null,
      "started_at": null,
      "completed_at": null,
      "evaluator_result": null,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ],
  "completed_this_session": [],
  "in_progress": [],
  "blocked": [],
  "next_actions": [
    {
      "action": "",
      "section": "",
      "priority": "P0",
      "context": ""
    }
  ],
  "blockers": [],
  "decisions_this_session": [],
  "deviations_this_session": [],
  "context_for_next_session": ""
}
```

**Key arrays:**

| Array | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `completed_this_session` | Section IDs finished in the current session |
| `in_progress` | Section IDs actively being worked on |
| `blocked` | Section IDs that cannot proceed |
| `next_actions` | Prioritized action items for the next session (P0/P1/P2) |
| `blockers` | Description of what is blocking progress |
| `decisions_this_session` | Implementation decisions made this session |
| `deviations_this_session` | Deviations from design documented this session |

The `context_for_next_session` field is a free-text summary that provides the next session with
everything it needs to continue work without re-reading all artifacts.

### phase7-handoff.md -- Exits the Build Loop into Documentation

The Build loop has no batch exit gate. It ends when a human declares the backlog
feature-complete; that declaration is `phase7-handoff.md`, which carries the work directly into
Documentation.

**Phase-specific content:**

- **What Was Built:** The capabilities that now exist, mapped to the specs that delivered them
- **System State:** Current state of the deployed system and its build/test status
- **Open Questions:** Q-NN items the Documentation phase must address
- **Deferred Items:** Work consciously left out, with justification
- **Documentation Focus:** Areas Documentation should prioritize for the cold-use verification

## 8. Later Phase Artifacts (Documentation, Deployment, Monitoring, Close)

### Phase 7: Documentation (2 artifacts + handoff)

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `api-docs.md` | API documentation for consumers |
| `RUNBOOK.md` | Operational runbook for deployment and maintenance |
| `phase8-handoff.md` | Handoff to Deployment with documentation summary |

### Phase 8: Deployment (3 artifacts + handoff)

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `deployment-checklist.md` | Pre-deployment verification steps |
| `release-notes.md` | Version changelog with features, fixes, and breaking changes |
| `smoke-test-results.md` | Post-deployment smoke test results per environment |
| `phase9-handoff.md` | Handoff to Monitoring with deployment summary |

### Phase 9: Monitoring (4 artifacts + handoff)

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `alert-definitions.md` | Alert rules, thresholds, and notification routing |
| `incident-response.md` | Incident classification levels and response procedures |
| `monitoring-config.md` | Dashboard inventory and metrics configuration |
| `project-retrospective.md` | Final project retrospective covering the entire SDLC cycle |
| `close-handoff.md` | Handoff to Close & Transfer with monitoring baseline summary |

### Phase C: Close & Transfer (4 artifacts, terminal)

The terminal phase. It proves the client can run everything without the pod -- shadow-flip,
harness audit, the close gate (the client runs one real spec end-to-end unassisted), and access
revocation.

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `final-handoff-report.md` | The closing handoff report to the client |
| `harness-audit.md` | Audit of the delivered harness against the delivery standard |
| `close-gate-evidence.md` | Evidence the client ran a real spec end-to-end unassisted |
| `access-revocation-checklist.md` | Pod access teardown checklist |

Phase 9 hands off to Phase C (Close & Transfer) via `close-handoff.md`. Phase C is terminal;
`final-handoff-report.md` is the project's closing document.

---

## 9. Handoff Document Protocol

Every phase transition produces a handoff document. These documents follow a standard format
and serve as the primary communication channel between phases.

### Standard Handoff Structure

All handoff documents follow this structure. The chain is `phase1-handoff.md`,
`phase2-handoff.md`, `phase3-handoff.md`, `build-handoff.md`, `phase7-handoff.md`,
`phase8-handoff.md`, `phase9-handoff.md`, `close-handoff.md` -- note the 3 → `build-handoff` → 7
jump, since the Build loop replaces the old phase 4/5/6 (there is no phase4/5/6-handoff):

1. **Phase Summary** -- compressed summary of work done in the completing phase
2. **Decisions Made** -- D-NN formatted decision table with rationale and approver
3. **What Next Phase Must Address** -- specific items the receiving phase is responsible for
4. **Open Questions** -- Q-NN or AQ-NN numbered items requiring resolution
5. **Known Risks** -- Risk table with descriptions and suggested mitigations
6. **Artifacts Produced** -- Checklist of all artifacts from the completing phase
7. **Exit Gate Status** -- Checklist of gate conditions with approval signature

### Open Question Protocol (Q-NN Format)

Open questions use a numbered format (Q-01, Q-02, ... or AQ-01, AQ-02 for architectural
questions) and are tracked across phase boundaries.

**Critical behavior:** The `/sdlc-next` command checks handoff documents for unresolved Q-NN
items. When entering a new phase, the SDLC system:

1. Reads the handoff document that was just produced
2. Extracts ALL Q-NN and AQ-NN items from "Open Questions", "What X Must Address", or similar headings
3. Displays them in a prominent block that cannot be overlooked
4. Requires that the receiving phase address each item before its own exit gate

Unresolved Q-NN items from a previous phase are a gate failure condition. They must be either
answered, explicitly deferred with justification, or determined to be no longer applicable.

### Decision Format (D-NN)

Decisions are tracked in tables throughout handoff documents:

```markdown
| Decision | What Was Decided | Rationale | Who Approved |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| D-01     | [Decision text] | [Why]     | [Name]      |
```

Decisions made in earlier phases are binding on later phases unless formally overridden
through an ADR or constitution amendment.

## 10. Artifact Lifecycle

Every artifact follows a predictable lifecycle from template to validated deliverable.

### Lifecycle Stages

```
1. TEMPLATE          Templates exist in plugin's templates/ directory
       |
2. COPIED            /sdlc-setup copies templates to .sdlc/artifacts/{phase}/
       |
3. IN PROGRESS       Phase work replaces placeholders with real content
       |
4. GATE 1: EXISTS    Gate checks that the artifact file exists at expected path
       |
5. GATE 2: COMPLETE  Gate scans for unfilled placeholders ([brackets], TODO, TBD)
       |
6. GATE 6: QUALITY   Gate evaluates content quality (profile-specific criteria)
       |
7. RECORDED          Artifact path added to state.yaml phase artifacts list
```

### Gate Interaction Details

**Gate 1 -- Existence Check:** Verifies that every artifact required by the current phase's
profile configuration exists as a file at the expected path under `.sdlc/artifacts/`. A missing
file is a hard gate failure.

**Gate 2 -- Completeness Check:** Scans artifact content for placeholder patterns:
- `[bracket text]` -- unfilled template placeholders
- `TODO` -- explicit incomplete markers
- `TBD` -- to-be-determined markers

Any remaining placeholder causes a gate failure. The gate reports which specific placeholders
remain unfilled so the author knows exactly what to complete.

**Gate 6 -- Quality Check:** Profile-specific quality evaluation. Different profiles may set
different quality thresholds. For example, the `microsoft-enterprise` profile may require
security review sign-off, while the `starter` profile may skip it.

### State Tracking

When a phase completes (all gates pass), the artifact paths are recorded in `state.yaml`:

```yaml
phases:
  0:
    name: discovery
    status: complete
    completed_at: "2025-03-20T14:30:00Z"
    artifacts:
      - "artifacts/00-discovery/constitution.md"
      - "artifacts/00-discovery/problem-statement.md"
      - "artifacts/00-discovery/success-criteria.md"
      - "artifacts/00-discovery/constraints.md"
      - "artifacts/00-discovery/phase1-handoff.md"
```

### Placeholder Conventions

Templates use these placeholder patterns consistently:

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `[Text in brackets]` | Must be replaced with project-specific content | `[Project Name]`, `[Specific number/condition]` |
| `${VARIABLE}` | System-replaced during initialization | `${PROFILE_ID}`, `${PROJECT_NAME}`, `${CREATED_AT}` |
| `<!-- REQUIRED: ... -->` | HTML comment marking required sections (not a placeholder to fill, but a validation hint) | `<!-- REQUIRED: risk-entry -- all attributes filled in -->` |
| `NNN` in identifiers | Sequential numbering placeholder | `FR-NNN`, `RISK-NNN`, `ADR-NNN` |
