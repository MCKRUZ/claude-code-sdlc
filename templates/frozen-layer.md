# Phase ${PHASE_ID}: ${PHASE_NAME} — Frozen Layer

## Decision

${GATE_DECISION} — Score: ${SCORE}. ${CONDITIONS_SUMMARY}

## Key Outcomes

- ${OUTCOME_1}
- ${OUTCOME_2}
- ${OUTCOME_3}

## Locked Metrics

> Include ONLY metrics with explicit values established in this phase.
> Omit this entire section if no metrics were established.
> Any change to these values in later phases requires a decision log entry.
> See `references/cross-phase-consistency.md`.
>
> Common metrics: Budget, Timeline, Scope boundaries, Stakeholder roster, Quality thresholds.
> Include only those with concrete values — never use "TBD" or "N/A".

## Risks & Mitigations

> Omit this section if no active risks were identified.

**Condensation Rules:**
- Target: 1500–2000 tokens (hard max: 2500)
- Priority: Locked Metrics > Constraints > Risks > Key Outcomes
- Omit boilerplate, template headers, and placeholder content
- Every value must trace to a source artifact
- Tables are preferred over prose for density
