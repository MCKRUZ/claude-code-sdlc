/** Turning stage readiness into a step-by-step sequence (spec 0017).
 *
 * One step per required document, in the stage's own declared order — `readiness.documents` is
 * already in that order (see electron/main/readiness.ts / scripts/stage_readiness.py's
 * `required_artifacts`) — plus a trailing Sign-off step.
 *
 * The rule spec 0017 fixes is the CURRENT step: the first not-ready document in that order,
 * never "whichever was edited most recently". This function only ever looks at order and each
 * document's own `ready` flag — there is no timestamp anywhere in a `StageDocument` for it to
 * consult even if it wanted to — so reopening a stage after touching a later document still
 * lands back where the sequence actually is. Once every document is ready, the Sign-off step
 * takes the current slot.
 *
 * This is the ONE place that decides done / current / locked. The Workflow tab and the
 * Documents tab both trace back to it — the Documents tab reads `document.ready` directly,
 * which is exactly what this derives "done" from — so the two can never disagree about how
 * many documents are done. That is spec 0017's shared-source acceptance check, made true by
 * construction rather than by convention.
