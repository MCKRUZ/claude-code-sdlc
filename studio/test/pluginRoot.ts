/** Locating the plugin the integration tests run against — and refusing to be quiet about it.
 *
 * Studio drives the claude-code-sdlc plugin's own scripts, so its most valuable tests need a
 * real plugin checkout with a real Python environment. When one cannot be located, those tests
 * skip. That is the right behaviour: somebody who has cloned Studio alone should still be able
 * to run its unit tests.
 *
 * What is NOT right is what used to happen next. A run where 31 of 33 window tests skipped
 * printed "2 passed" and exited 0, which is indistinguishable from a run that proved
 * everything. It caused a false report of what had been verified — the same failure this whole
 * product is built to prevent, sitting in its own test suite.
 *
 * So an unavailable plugin is now an ERROR by default, naming what was looked for and how to
 * point at the right place, and a person who genuinely wants the Studio-only tests says so out
 * loud with STUDIO_SKIP_PLUGIN_TESTS=1. Silence is no longer one of the options.
 *
 * WHERE IT LOOKS. Studio lives in `studio/` inside the plugin's own repository, so the plugin
 * is simply the directory this folder sits in. That one fact replaced an earlier search that
 * hunted for a sibling checkout and then scanned its git worktrees: when Studio ships inside
 * the repository, a worktree carries its own copy of this folder, so the parent directory is
 * already the right plugin for whichever branch the tests are running on. Nothing to search.
 *
 * What CAN still be missing is the Python environment under `scripts/.venv` — a fresh clone
 * has no such thing. That is the case these tests now fail loudly on, which is correct: the
 * environment is buildable, and a run that quietly proved nothing is worse than a red one.
