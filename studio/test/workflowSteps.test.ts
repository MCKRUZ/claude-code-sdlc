/** The pure function spec 0017 pins everything else to: given a stage's readiness, which step
 * is done, which is current, and which is locked.
 *
 * The line these tests hold is the one the spec names explicitly: the current step is the
 * FIRST not-ready document in the stage's own declared order, never "whichever was edited most
 * recently" — and this module has no notion of "recently" to fall back on even if it wanted to,
 * since a `StageDocument` carries no timestamp. That absence is itself part of the proof: the
 * "reopen after touching a later document" scenario is not something this function can get
 * wrong by accident, because the information that would let it is not there.
 *
 * The done-count parity test is the shared-source acceptance check made mechanical: the
 * Workflow tab and the Documents tab must report the same number of finished documents because
 * both trace back to `document.ready`, and this pins that tracing rather than trusting it.
