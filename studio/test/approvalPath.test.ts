/** Saving a document, with and without an approval step, against a REAL git remote.
 *
 * Spec 0010's approval checks were the last part with no verification at all, on the grounds
 * that they "need a real code host". Two thirds of that turns out to be wrong: the mechanism
 * is ordinary git. A pending draft is a branch, and what makes it pending is that the push to
 * the shared branch was REFUSED — which a local repository can refuse just as well as GitHub
 * can. Only opening the pull request itself needs GitHub.
 *
 * So this builds a bare repository to act as the remote, clones it, and saves for real:
 *
 *   approval off   → the change lands on the shared branch, with who and why recorded
 *   push refused   → the shared branch is left exactly as it was, and the work is parked on
 *                    a branch of its own instead
 *
 * The refusal is done with a server-side hook, which is how branch protection behaves from
 * the client's point of view: the push is simply rejected. That is also the app's own stated
 * gate — "the real gate is whether a direct push gets rejected", never a guess about settings.
 *
 * A later pass found the last sentence above was wrong in one respect: "who opened it" is just
 * a name Studio stores locally the moment a draft's pull request is created, so the REFUSAL is
 * provable here without a second machine — seed the same persisted state a real save would
 * have left, then call save() for real as a different actor and watch it refuse before it ever
 * touches the network. What still needs GitHub is the pull request itself, which is why the
 * seed is written directly rather than produced by driving a whole save through this fixture.
