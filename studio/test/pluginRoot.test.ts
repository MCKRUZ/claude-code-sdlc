/** Locating the plugin, and refusing to be quiet about not finding it.
 *
 * This exists because of a real, embarrassing failure in this repository's own verification: a
 * window-test run where 31 of 33 tests skipped printed "2 passed" and exited 0. That is
 * indistinguishable from a run that proved everything, and it produced a false report of what
 * had been verified — the exact failure mode the whole product is built to prevent, sitting
 * inside its own test suite.
 *
 * So the property under test is not "can it find a plugin". It is "can a run that proved
 * nothing ever look like a run that proved something".
