/** The codified hostile-scratch-project test (spec 0016's own Scope and Decision List).
 *
 * The design was verified safe by hand once, against a live scratch project set up as a trap —
 * a hook that writes a marker file the instant it runs, a CLAUDE.md carrying a planted
 * instruction — driven the way chat.ts's real driver actually would: working directory left at
 * claudeWorkingDirectory(), the trap directory granted only through --add-dir. This file makes
 * that proof permanent and automated rather than a one-off manual run, per the spec's own
 * acceptance check.
 *
 * Two separable properties, tested two different ways:
 *
 *  1. "A planted hook never fires." This is a STARTUP-time fact about where `claude` looks for
 *     settings/hooks (the working directory), independent of anything the model decides to do —
 *     so it is provable with a real, but small and cheap, live process. Skipped (never failed)
 *     when there is no signed-in `claude` to run against, the same STUDIO_SKIP_LIVE_MODEL /
 *     runtime-failure convention documents.spec.ts already uses for its own live-model test.
 *
 *  2. "A planted CLAUDE.md sentinel is absent from every prompt sent to the model unless the
 *     conversation explicitly reads that file." This is a claim about STUDIO'S OWN CODE — does
 *     chat.ts's prompt construction ever embed a file's content? — not about model self-
 *     restraint, and it is fully provable by reading buildChatArgs()/buildSystemPrompt()'s own
 *     source and asserting on their output with NO live call at all (see chatArgs.test.ts's
 *     "never embeds any file content" test, and the second test below, which plants a REAL
 *     sentinel file in a REAL hostile project directory and proves the built prompt does not
 *     contain it — deterministic, and it runs every time, not skippable).
